# Almirante Engine #

### Overview ###

This is a project I made back in 2012. It's a (2D) game engine made on top of Microsoft's XNA Framework - Basically a collection of features that (in my opinion) are essential when making a 2D game. I've tried to keep the code clean, and some of the features are not complete at all.
